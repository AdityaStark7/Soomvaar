# **Twitter Sentimental Analysis in ML**


**GOAL**

- The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.



**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140).



**WHAT I HAD DONE**

- It is a Natural Language Processing Problem where Sentiment Analysis is done by Classifying the Positive tweets from negative tweets by machine learning models for classification, **text mining**, **text analysis**, **data analysis** and **data visualization**.



**MODELS USED**

-  Linear Regression
-  StandardScaler
-  RandomForestClassifier
-  DecisionTreeClassifier


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- keras
- 
**Accuracy of different models used**

By using Linear Regression I got 
 ```python
    Train set Accuracy:   0.5191175930606196
 ``` 

By using Random Forest Classifier I got 
 ```python
    Train set Accuracy:   0.9894093667260677
 ``` 
 
 By using Decision Tree Classifier I got 
 ```python
    Train set Accuracy:   0.9894132729791195
 ``` 
 
 **CONCLUSION**

Performance of **Decision Tree Classifie**r is better in terms of accuracy as compared to **linear regression** and **Random Forest Classifier**.
