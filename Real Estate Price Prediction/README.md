# **Real Estate Price Prediction**

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to predict house price from features as house age,number of convenience stores,  transaction date etc.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/quantbruce/real-estate-price-prediction).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Preprocessing & Exploration
- Step 2: Data Visualization
- Step 3: Data Training & Model Creation
- Step 4: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
-  Linear Regression
-  Decision Tree Regressor
-  Random Forest Regressor



**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**Accuracy of different models used**
- By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  55.58
 ``` 
 - By using Decision Tree Regressor model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  98.25
 ``` 
  - By using Random Forest Regressor model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  93.59
 ```



**CONCLUSION**

Performance of Decision tree regressor is better in terms of accuracy as compared to linear regression and random forest regressor.
